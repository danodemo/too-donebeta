Notes for weekend
--Figure out the schema
Migrations for tasks and todolists

--Associations
Figure out associations for each model (they can have multiple associations)
  --> Users has_many todolists
  --> Todolists owned_by users; has_many tasks
  --> Tasks owned_by todolists

  The command "find_or_create_by" will need to be used to assign tasks to the right list for each user

  Put LOGGING=true before the commands to see SQL data on them.
